# Todo App

## Instructions: Make a frontend-only todo list app

* It has three vertical lists. Todo, Doing, and Done
* Items are created via a form (they can be stored in browser state, no need to have
a backend)
* Items are draggable from one list to another
* Items can be reordered within a list
* When you drag an item into the Done list, confetti explodes on the screen! Or
something else interesting. You can use a package for this.
* Overall the app has a usable design with a unique color palette. You are free to
make whatever UI and UX decisions you want to make it usable. Don't worry, we aren't looking for a groundbreaking innovative design. Just lay things out decently and add some colors.
